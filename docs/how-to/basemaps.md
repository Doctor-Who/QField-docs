QField is able to load a base map from a web service.

In QGIS with the plugin QFieldSync, set the base map to the \"Project
Configuration\"

![sync_basemap](../assets/images/qfield-sync_basemap.png){width="400px"}

Then make the package of the project to load it on your device.

![sync_package1](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package1.png){width="400px"}

![sync_package2](../assets/images/qfield-sync_package2.png){width="400px"}

Below the result on QField.

![image](..../assets/images/qfield_basemap1.jpg){width="200px"}

![image](..../assets/images/qfield_basemap2.jpg){width="200px"}
